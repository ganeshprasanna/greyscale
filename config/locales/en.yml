# Files in the config/locales directory are used for internationalization
# and are automatically loaded by Rails. If you want to use locales other
# than English, add the necessary files in this directory.
#
# To use the locales, use `I18n.t`:
#
#     I18n.t 'hello'
#
# In views, this is aliased to just `t`:
#
#     <%= t('hello') %>
#
# To use a different locale, set it with `I18n.locale`:
#
#     I18n.locale = :es
#
# This would use the information in config/locales/es.yml.
#
# To learn more, please read the Rails Internationalization guide
# available at http://guides.rubyonrails.org/i18n.html.

  about5: "The Foundation fulfills the philanthropic mission of the Trust by supporting individuals from the Gatty Community committed towards advancement of Education.Late Shri Shivaram Gatty was a scholar himself having obtained his Bachelor degree in

Arts from the Government College Mangalore in the year 1930. He was the first graduate from

the Gatty Community. He served as the Sheristedar (Principal Officer) in the Judicial Department

(Courts) for over 38 years. Late Smt. Susheela Gatty, a non-matriculate village woman, shared

the burden of up-bringing her children by selling milk. Perceiving the value of education, both of

them imparted the best education to all their children despite financial difficulties.

Late Shri Shivaram Gatty was the Founder President of the Gatty Samaja Seva Sangha in

1947 and contributed to the formation and development of the Sangha in the formative stage

which now has grown into a mammoth Organisation. He has also served our Kulaswamy Shri

Somanatha as the Aadalitha Mukthesara of Shree Somanatha Temple, Someshwar.

To pay our tributes to these great souls who laid the foundation to the Mannagudde

Gatty Family, we have formed this Trust in 2015 for continuing their vision of “Education for All”.

This is the third year of progress of our Foundation.

The Foundation is a philanthropic charitable Trust, focused on up-liftment of meritorious

and economically deserving students, to achieve higher level of education by extending them

support by way of monetary help through periodic and/or annual scholarships besides

recognizing the academic achievers.

The corpus of the Foundation is solely contributed by the Trustees."
